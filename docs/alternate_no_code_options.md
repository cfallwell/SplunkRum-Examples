# Alternate No-Code Options

If edge injection is not available but you control another shared entrypoint:

- Tag manager (GTM, Tealium, Adobe Launch): add a tag that injects the script early.
- Shared layout/theme system: add the script in the shared template.
- Internal browser extension (internal tools only): inject scripts into specified domains.
